1)fermi_integrals_calculator_1.m calculates fermi integrals on given k(k-values are in array) and discrete values of q using Gauss-Legendre Method

2)fermi integrals_calculator_2.m calcualtes Fermi integrals using Simpsons integration method


3)fermi integrals_calculator_3.m calculates Fermi integrals on any k and q values its Matlabs function and can be called using 
fermi integrals_calculator3(q,k)  q and k are any values.It can be used for any calculations with other formulas


4)legendrePolynomials_1.m calculates and generates Legendre Polynomials using Matlabs built in function and calculates its roots and weights

5)legendrePolynomials_2.m  calculates and generates Legendre Polynomials using recursion and calculates its roots and weighs

comperision of calculated 20 roots and weights and given in coefficients folder they are nearly same.Also in files "roots.txt" and "weights.txt" are given 100 coefficients of calculated roots and weights using legendrePolynomials_1.m program.

6)calculated Fermi integrals values using Gauss-Legendre method (fermi_integrals_calculator_1.m) are given in integral_values_1 folder
7)calculated Fermi integrals values using Simpsons  method (fermi_integrals_calculator_2.m) are given in integral_values_1 folder
